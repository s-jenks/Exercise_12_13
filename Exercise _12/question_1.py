# Question 1

cheese = ['Cheddar','Stilton','Cornish Yarg']
cheese+=['Oke','Gouda'] # This has printed separately due to there being no square brackets and does not recognise it as a list
# item.
# You can add two or more items by adding a comma and a square bracket
print(cheese)

tup= 'Hello'
print(len(tup))  # This prints out 5 as there are 5 characters in this variable

tup = 'Hello',
print(len(tup)) # The comma makes this a tuple which returns a length of 1 as there is only one item
